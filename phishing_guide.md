# Avoiding Phishing Scams\n\n1. **Verify URLs**: Always check wallet or exchange URLs. Look for HTTPS and correct domain names (e.g., avoid 'binanace.com').
\n2. **Check Email Senders**: Verify sender addresses. Avoid clicking links in unsolicited emails claiming to be from exchanges.
\n3. **Avoid Social Media Scams**: Donâ€™t trust DMs or posts promising airdrops or free crypto; verify via official channels.
